### about
after spending more than 30 hrs on my [previous project](https://github.com/yonzui/personal-website) , i wanted to do something a lot simpler! this website contains
3 different recipes i frequently make, including acai bowls, a taco bell crunchwrap copycat, and oatmeal cookies! i used html and css in vscode to develop this site. this project was made apart of hack club's athena award.

### struggles/outcomes
i actually did struggle a little bit with the hover effect. i wanted the cards to have a flipping animation, rather than there being a larger 
box shadow when hovering over the cards. after trying to implement that, i decided that the flip effect didn't look as good as i thought. in the future, i'll probably try the flip card effect again once i get it down.
